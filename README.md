# The Reviewer

The Reviewer will be a production quality Xamarin.Forms application demonstrating how to integrate with several Azure offerings.

The Reviewer will display reviews of local businesses, allow users to enter reviews, allow business owners to claim a property, and it will send notifications of specials/coupons for businesses.

It will also utilize App Center for running tests and deployments.

## Azure

The following Azure offerings will be used to build the app.

- Azure AD B2C
- Azure Functions
- Azure Mobile App Services
- Azure App Services
- Notification Hubs
- Blob Storage
- CosmosDB
- Cognitive Services
- Application Insights
- App Center

## Xamarin.Forms

Straight Xamarin.Forms, including its built-in MVVM will be used as the app's architecture. This will demonstrate such features as:

- Data binding
- Message Center
- Dependency Service
- Triggers
- Styles
- Data template selectors

## Where's the Code?

You mean a readme isn't good enough? The code will be built as I go through a blog series of each of the Azure functions above. 

Right now the first series on Azure AD B2C is occuring. You can read the [blogs here](https://msou.co/8d) and see the [demo code here](https://msou.co/8c). When the series is done, the intial app will appear in this repo.
